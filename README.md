# Front End Engineer Assessment

I started with Create-React-App and tried to work my way towards the solution as fast as possible.

For styling, I used reactstrap which is basically Bootstrap for React and I tried to showcase the different components which led to the application having a clean User Interface.

For the graph, I initially started with `react-chartkick` but the data became chart came out to be imprecise as it was not able to handle the final `01-02-31` incorrect date.

I checked more libraries and chose `react-easy-chart` because I did not have to manipulate the data much.

Given more time, I would have set up tests that would have stopped the flow of incorrect data into the application and used a better charting library.

This project is live. You can check it out [here]().
